          <div>Prevention of illness and support of development are key aspects of our pediatric care.There is no one who is more interdependent on family for their health and wellness than children. Because we practice family medical care, we can treat the whole family when they are sick. We understand that parents with young children cannot wait long for their doctor to enter the room. We also understand that you may need to be seen today, which is why we offer same day and walk-in visits. </div>
          <div>We understand that children are often noticed to fall ill after parents return home from work. This is why we have an After Hours Clinic with extended hours to serve your needs and accommodate your busy schedule. The After hours clinic does not require an appointment and is open at 5:30.</div>
