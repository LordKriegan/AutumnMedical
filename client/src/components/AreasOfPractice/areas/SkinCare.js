                <h2>Skin Care</h2>
                <hr />
                <div>At the Autumn Medical Group, we routinely and successfully treat acne, eczema, psoriasis, hives, allergic reactions, rashes, and wounds. We also offer Aesthetic Dermatology treatments including:</div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Botox</h3>
                    <span>Wrinkles are actually creases that have been worn into the skin by making the same expression thousands of times. These "expression lines" often called frown lines or crows feet, are due to contraction of a muscle under the skin. Botox, a purified protein, can dramatically smooth out and soften wrinkle lines. It has been safely used for over 10 years and is approved by the FDA. A few drops of Botox are injected with a tiny microneedle precisely into the muscle to weaken and relax the muscle. As a result, the skin overlying the muscle relaxes and the wrinkles disappear.</span>

                <div>
                    <h3>Dermal Fillers</h3>
                    <span>Dermal fillers work to correct wrinkles, lift facial contours and enhance lips. They are made of Hyaluronic acid, which is a natural substance found in the skin and other tissues throughout the body. Results can often be seen immediately.</span>

                <div>
                    <h3>Sclerotherapy Laser and IPL treatments</h3>
                    <span>Sclerotherapy was developed over 75 years ago and today is one of the most common treatments for spider and varicose veins. During the treatment, a sclerosing agent is injected into the vein through a tiny needle. The solution, once injected into the vein, replaces the blood in the vein and causes irritation and corrosion to the walls of the vessels. The body then begins the natural healing process and the vein begins to decompose, shrink and eventually disappear. We also use Laser and IPL technology to rapidly and painlessly remove spider veins from the face and legs.</span>
