          <div>We accomplish this by employing the guidelines from the American Academy of Family Practice, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Heart Association, American Lung Association, and American Diabetes Association in an integrated comprehensive medical care plan to seamlessly assess, screen treat and prevent the complications of many debilitating medical conditions in order to insure a long and healthy life.</div>
